Under the app's name, you should explain the topic, giving a **brief description** of the **app's functionality** (what is it for?) in a store.

Next, you can **add media** (either an image of a GIF) if possible, so that users can better understand how the app works in practice. 

![Media Placeholder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52087100/71204177-42ca4f80-227e-11ea-89e6-e92e65370c69.png)

## Configuration

It is possible to install in your store either by using App Store or the VTEX IO Toolbelt.

### Using VTEX App Store

1. Access the **Apps** section in your account's admin page and look for the Icommkt box;
2. Then, click on the **Install** button;
3. You'll see a warning message about needing to enter the necessary configurations. Scroll down and type in your **NAME OF A SETTINGS FIELD** in the `NAME OF THE APP` field.
4. Click on **Save**.

### Using VTEX IO Toolbelt

1. [Install](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/installing-an-app/) the `vtex.icommkt@0.x` app. You can confirm that the app has now been installed by running `vtex ls` again. 
2. Access the **Apps** section in your account's admin page and look for the NAME OF THE APP box. Once you find it, click on the box.
3. Fill in the `NAME OF THE APP` field with your **NAME OF THE SETTINGS FIELD**.
4. Click on **Save**.

<!-- Remember to also **showcase any necessary disclaimer** related to the app in this section, such as the different behavior it may display during its configuration. -->

## Modus Operandi *(not mandatory)*

There are scenarios in which an app can behave differently in a store, according to its configuration. It's crucial then to go through these **behavioral changes** in this section, allowing users to fully understand the **practical application** of the app in their store.

If you feel compelled to give further details, such as the app's **relationship with others**, don't hesitate to use this section.
